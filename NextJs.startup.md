Build a polished single‑page application (SPA) 
Named: <PROVIDE_NAME_HERE>. 
The SPA should be built with latest Next.js using app router, TypeScript, Tailwind 4+, and Turbopack as the bundler.

Content & Structure

- Hero section with text, image and CTA
- About
- Services
- Contact form
- Footer


Other info:
- for images placeholder you can use  link https://placehold.co/<width><height>/png 
- Configure Tailwind CSS for styling; prefer utility classes to build responsive layouts. no var in the classes, use tailwind v4 variables configuration
- Organize reusable UI components in a components/shared directory.
- For the WhatsApp button, use an icon from a library (e.g., react-icons/fa for the WhatsApp logo) and style it with Tailwind so it stands out (e.g., rounded, green background on hover).
- Ensure the SPA is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile.
- Include SEO‑friendly meta tags describing the property and its unique artistic features.
