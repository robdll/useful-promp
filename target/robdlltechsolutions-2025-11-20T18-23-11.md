I want to build a Next.js application. 

Here is the base technical requirement:
---
Project Goal
Build a polished single‑page application (SPA) 
The SPA should be built with latest Next.js using app router, TypeScript, Tailwind 4+, and Turbopack as the bundler.

Content & Structure

- Navbar with logo, links, and language selector, use hamburger menu for mobile
- Hero section with text, image and CTA
- About
- Services
- Contact form
- Footer


Other info:
- for images placeholder you can use  link https://placehold.co/<width><height>/png 
- Configure Tailwind CSS for styling; prefer utility classes to build responsive layouts. no var in the classes, use tailwind v4 variables configuration
- Organize reusable UI components in a components/shared directory.
- For the WhatsApp button, use an icon from a library (e.g., react-icons/fa for the WhatsApp logo) and style it with Tailwind so it stands out (e.g., rounded, green background on hover).
- Ensure the SPA is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile.
- Include SEO‑friendly meta tags describing the property and its unique artistic features.

Here are the specific details for my project that need to be incorporated and override any generic placeholders:

- **Project Name**: RobDllTechSolutions
- **Description**: target: small businesses without a website. Service: landing creation, hosting, and support in content generation.
- **Design Style**: glassmorphism with soft animations

Please act as an expert software architect and prompt engineer. 
Take the "base technical requirement" above and rewrite it into a single, comprehensive, and improved prompt that I can give to an AI coding assistant. 
The new prompt should:
1. Integrate the project name, description, and style into the requirements.
2. Expand on the design style with specific Tailwind CSS suggestions relevant to "glassmorphism with soft animations".
3. Keep all the technical constraints (Next.js, App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind 4+, Turbopack, component organization, etc.).
4. Improve the clarity and robustness of the instructions.
